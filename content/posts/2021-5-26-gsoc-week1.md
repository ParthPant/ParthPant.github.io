#Community Bonding
Since this period is a part of the GSoC community bonding period, I spent much of
my time going through the codebase and trying to understand how existing implementation
of snapping works and asking the community what I do not understand.

#Adding Preferences
Currently snapping prefferences reside in the **Document Properties Dialog** under the
Snap tab. So the first thing I added was a category called "_Alignment Snapping_" to that
dialog.

#Alignment Snapper Class
Inkscape already uses a class named `ObjectSnapper` to snap point on objects to other
objects. This class is the base on top of which I build. So I wrote a very rudimentary
implementation of an  `AlignmentSnapper` class that allows aligning objects to nearby objects.
This is still a very early stage in implementation and is far from ready. There is
a lot that needs to be optimised for example `ObjectSnapper` and `AlignmentSnapper` can
benifit from sharing data with each other.

Having said that, here is a list of things that work and things that don't!

##What Works
- Snapping to corners, center and edge midpoints of other object's bounding box
- PreSnapping tools to draw aligned objects
- Snapping to page corners and midpoint if Toggle Snapping to Page Border option is enabled
- While editing paths nodes snap to the nodes in the object and bounding boxes of other objects
- Set Alignment tolerance in the Document Properties dialog


##Known Bugs
- Source object's nodes are snapped instead of its bounding box points
- While editing paths, the snapping is not as responsive

`SnapIndicator` has not been updated so it uses the existing implementation and
give a warning and shows `UNDEFINED` snap type.

No toggles have been implemented as of now.

#Next Up
Since now I have basic _Smart Snapping_ working more or less how I would want it
to work like, the next step would be to discuss with #team_ux how exactly we want
this feature to behave, what should be the different settings and toggle options.
Apart from this the next major step would be to extend the `SnapIndicator` class.
