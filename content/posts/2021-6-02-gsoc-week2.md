## Adding Toggles

This week started with me trying to add alignment snapping toggles to Inkscape.
This took some time as at first I could not figure out how Gio::Actions are set up
but finally by following how other toggles were implemented I was able to get this
to work.

In the present state of the MR the following toggles exist:

- **Toggle Alignment Snapping** option in Snap Controllers Toolbar
  - **Toggle snapping to other nodes in the same path while editing paths** as a
  sub-option
  - Snapping to page corners and midpoint if **Toggle Snapping to Page Border option**
  is enabled

Icons for these still need to be designed.

## Bug Fixes

Last week there was a bug where the nodes of the object being transformed were
also being snapped. This was an easy fix by just passing the Bounding Box points
as Snap Source points in `Seltrans` and adding some toggle checks.

## Snap Priority

It is highly probable that when we look for potential snap positions, an alignment
snap positon is the closest. This can be annoying when you are trying to snap to
other locations (a corner for example). To fix this I modified the `SnappedPoint::findBestSnap()`
function to give priority to all other snap locations over Alignment Snap positions.

## Viewport

While aligment snapping, looking for all the items in the document can be resource
intensive. Hence its makes sense to only look for items that are currently visible
in the viewport. This reduces the number of points we need to check and also enhances
the UX as you will no longer snap to an object you can not see in the viewport.

## Constraints

Constraint movements are pretty useful and Alignment Snapping now takes them into
account. While `Ctrl` is pressed the object only moves in either Horizontal or
Vertical direction. If the object is being moved in the Y direction, it will not
snap to alignment guides that are vertical. Similarly if it is being moved in X
direction, it will not snap to Horizontal guides.

## Horizontal and Vertical Lines

Objects will now snap to points of intersection of two alignment guides. Hence you
can now simultaneously align objects vertically and horizontally with respect to
two neighbouring objects.

## Snap Indicators

With the work of actually finding and snapping to alignment locations almost done,
this week I also started looking into the implementation of `SnapIndicator` class.
The behaviour of Alignment Snap Indicators is very different from that of the
conventional Snap Indicators in Inkscape, in that the alignment indicators disappear
when an object is _ungrabbed_ and opposed to other snap indicators that have a set
lifetime.

## Next Up

Next week I will look into better understanding how canvas works in Inkscape and
try to figure out a nice way to display the Alignment Indicators that behave as
described above.
