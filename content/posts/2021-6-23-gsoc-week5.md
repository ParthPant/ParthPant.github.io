## Improving Distribution Snapping

I added a very rough implementation of distribution snapping last week and this
week I tried to improve the code. Implementing distribution snapping has been
a lot more challenging than alignment snapping and I am glad it is coming along
so well. This week I was also able to add Bidirectional distribution snapping and
also imporve the existing algorithm. Up until last week the number of objects that
were considered to be equidistant was not fixed and it varied each time you moved an
object. Now this should be much more consistent, though in some cases there may be a
little difference. Overall distribution snapping algorithm now runs faster than it did
before.

Snap indicators also have been updated to take into account more snap possibilities.
I spent a lot of time this week cleaning up the code and that must help readability a lot.

## Next Up

Distribution snapping, in its current form does not take multiple snap possibilities
into account for now. I hope to improve the algorithm to work more like it does on Figma.
