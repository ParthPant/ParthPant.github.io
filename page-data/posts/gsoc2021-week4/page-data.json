The inspiration for this feature\ncomes from UI design programs like Figma and Penpot. At its core, distribution snapping\nindicates that certain objects are equidistant from each other in either Horizontal\nor Vertical direction. OnCanvas Distribuiton Guides have enormous potential to increase\nworkflow speeds. This feature will provide a much faster way to space objects than\nthe currently existing Distribution options in the <code class=\"language-text\">Align and Distribute objects</code>\ndialog box.</p>\n<p>At its current state, Distribution snapping in Inkscape works for most intents and\npurposes but itâ€™s behaviour is limited if compared with something like Figma. Most\nof these limitations are a direct consequence of how this feature is implemented\nin code. I am not really sure of how much it is possible to replicate other programs\nwithout making some radical changes to how Inkscape handles snapping.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bug-fixes\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bug-fixes\" aria-label=\"bug fixes permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<p><em>With a new features come a lot of new bugs ;)</em></p>\n<p>It took a lot of time to make sure that alignment snapping works well with the\npreviously implemented alignment snapping which is also a part of this project.\nThere were quite a few bugs I encountered while implementing snap indicators for\ndistribution snapping. Also taking overlapping objects into account while looking\nfor equidistant objects was a bit of a challenge.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/47bacb1596a5ab0518bc313bbd294733/inkscape-overlap.gif\" alt=\"Image\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"snap-distance\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#snap-distance\" aria-label=\"snap distance permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Snap Distance</h2>\n<p>Both Distribution and Alignment snapping now show the snap distance. For alignment\nsnapping, this inspiration was taken from Affinity Designer which does something\nsimilar. This feature however can be turned off from Preferences in the snapping\npage in case you feel that showing distances causes unnecessary clutter.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/445e27ff7b769717083e3d0a0b575466/inkscape-distance.gif\" alt=\"Image\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"next-up\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#next-up\" aria-label=\"next up permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Next Up</h2>\n<p>Distribution snapping needs some more testing. I think at its current state it is\npretty functional but it can always be improved. I also have plans to make the\nalignment and distribution indicators appear more fluid using fade-in and fade-out\nanimations.</p>\n<p>Also Alignment and Distribution snapping will likely be merged into just one feature\nthat will have a nice name (smart snapping, intelligent snapping, big brain snapping, etc.)</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/gsoc2021-week4","tagSlugs":["/tag/g-so-c-21/","/tag/inkscape/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-06-16T06:31+00:00","description":"Week 4 progress on my GSoC Project at Inkscape","tags":["GSoC'21","Inkscape"],"title":"Week 4 - OnCanvas Alignment Guides","socialImage":{"publicURL":"/static/c7b626445e86bd4d36091b2a07161dac/snap.png"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/posts/gsoc2021-week4"}},"staticQueryHashes":["251939775","401334301","825871152"]}
