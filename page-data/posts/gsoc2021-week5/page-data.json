Implementing distribution snapping has been\na lot more challenging than alignment snapping and I am glad it is coming along\nso well. This week I was also able to add Bidirectional distribution snapping and\nalso imporve the existing algorithm. Up until last week the number of objects that\nwere considered to be equidistant was not fixed and it varied each time you moved an\nobject. Now this should be much more consistent, though in some cases there may be a\nlittle difference. Overall distribution snapping algorithm now runs faster than it did\nbefore.</p>\n<p>Snap indicators also have been updated to take into account more snap possibilities.\nI spent a lot of time this week cleaning up the code and that must help readability a lot.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/17a8d38d1118c386fafae28e5887c9f1/bidirectional.gif\" alt=\"Image\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"next-up\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#next-up\" aria-label=\"next up permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Next Up</h2>\n<p>Distribution snapping, in its current form does not take multiple snap possibilities\ninto account for now.
